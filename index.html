              No sweat! We will meet you at your property to view it. We will walk through the house and give you our suggestions on what is needed to lease it and what items are required by the Texas Property Code. The first step can be a little nerve-wracking, especially if this is your first time leasing out your house. No worries! We will make sure well qualified tenants are approved for your house.

              Once all parties sign the management agreement, we take pictures and list the property on the Houston Multiple Listing website. It will also go to Zillow and Realtor.com. All real estate agents in the Greater Houston and surrounding area will be able to view the property and be able to set up an appointment for their clients. We also utilize Houston Centralized Showing Services. This ensures that all appointments are documented and allows agents to give feedback on their visits. This is where we can enter special showing guidelines for the showing agent, for example, to have visitors take off their shoes at the door, or to ensure all lights are turned off when leaving and the climate control set back to the requested temperature.

              Potential tenants complete applications and must supply proof of income. We do not pick the first applicant that comes by; we make sure to choose the best qualified tenant for your house. Our process ensures that the tenant can afford the lease and includes a debit-to-income model that qualifies the tenant.  We want them to pay on time each month, and to take excellent care of your investment.

          <li class="text">
            <p class="body-1">
              Home inspections: We complete annual home inspections and give owners a full report with pictures of the house and yard (for an extra charge)
            </p>
            <p class="body-1">
              Leases and renewals: We handle the signing process and send owners a scanned copy
            </p>
            <p class="body-1">
              Rent collection: We collect payments and disburse them monthly to owners by ACH or paper check
            </p>
            <p class="body-1">
              Work request processing: We call on qualified contractors from our carefully selected list and make sure to email owners each time we receive a work request from the tenant
            </p>
            <p class="body-1">
              Great communication: We conduct all communications with tenants and owners by EMAIL and strive to make sure repairs are done right and at a reasonable cost
            </p>
            <p class="body-1">
              And if the time comes that you want to sell your house or condo, our licensed Texas Real Estate Commission Broker on staff can help you with that, too. We charge less than your average real estate office, and offer the same or better services than other broker agencies.
